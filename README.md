# Homework2-Responsive-Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a platform for me to showcase my talents and projects as a developer in the form of a website with a section about me, my portfolio, and a contact me form. This project will help me easily provide a means for potential employers to see some of the projects and applications I will be working on for this class. 

This project has helped greatly expand my knowledge of Bootstrap, CSS, and page responsiveness. I also learned to commit early and commit often! Lastly, I learned a great deal about webpage layout best practices. 

## Usage

Navigate between the three webpages (About Me; Portfolio; Contact) by using the navbar at the top of the page.
